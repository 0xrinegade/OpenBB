A score of -5 to -2.22 indicated a low chance of fraud, a score of -2.22 to -1.78 indicates a moderate change of fraud, and a score above -1.78 indicated a high chance of fraud.","[Source: Wikipedia]"," DSRI: Days Sales in Receivables Index gauges whether receivables and revenue are out of balance, a large number is expected to be associated with a higher likelihood that revenues and earnings are overstated. GMI: Gross Margin Index shows if gross margins are deteriorating. Research suggests that firms with worsening gross margin are more likely to engage in earnings management, therefore there should be a positive correlation between GMI and probability of earnings management. AQI: Asset Quality Index measures the proportion of assets where potential benefit is less certain. A positive relation between AQI and earnings manipulation is expected. SGI: Sales Growth Index shows the amount of growth companies are having. Higher growth companies are more likely to commit fraud so there should be a positive relation between SGI and earnings management. DEPI: Depreciation Index is the ratio for the rate of depreciation. A DEPI greater than 1 shows that the depreciation rate has slowed and is positively correlated with earnings management. SGAI: Sales General and Administrative Expenses Index measures the change in SG&A over sales. There should be a positive relationship between SGAI and earnings management. LVGI: Leverage Index represents change in leverage. A LVGI greater than one indicates a lower change of fraud. TATA: Total Accruals to Total Assets is a proxy for the extent that cash underlies earnings. A higher number is associated with a higher likelihood of manipulation. Z-score: ------------------------------------------------ The Zmijewski Score is a bankruptcy model used to predict a firm's bankruptcy in two years. The ratio uses in the Zmijewski score were determined by probit analysis (think of probit as probability unit). In this case, scores less than .5 represent a higher probability of default. One of the criticisms that Zmijewski made was that other bankruptcy scoring models oversampled distressed firms and favored situations with more complete data.","[Source: YCharts]"," McKee-score: ------------------------------------------------ The McKee Score is a bankruptcy model used to predict a firm's bankruptcy in one yearIt looks at a company's size, profitability, and liquidity to determine the probability.This model is 80% accurate in predicting bankruptcy."),(0,r.kt)("h3",{id:"usage"},"Usage"),(0,r.kt)("pre",null,(0,r.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-python",metastring:"wordwrap",wordwrap:!0},"fraud [-t TICKER] [-e] [-d]\n")),(0,r.kt)("hr",null),(0,r.kt)("h2",{id:"parameters"},"Parameters"),(0,r.kt)("table",null,(0,r.kt)("thead",{parentName:"table"},(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"thead"},(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Name"),(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Parameter"),(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Description"),(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Default"),(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Optional"),(0,r.kt)("th",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Choices"))),(0,r.kt)("tbody",{parentName:"table"},(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"tbody"},(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"ticker"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"-t  --ticker"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Ticker to analyze"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"None"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"True"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"None")),(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"tbody"},(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"exp"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"-e  --explanation"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Shows an explanation for the metrics"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"False"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"True"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"None")),(0,r.kt)("tr",{parentName:"tbody"},(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"detail"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"-d  --detail"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"Shows the details for calculating the mscore"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"False"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"True"),(0,r.kt)("td",{parentName:"tr",align:null},"None")))),(0,r.kt)("hr",null))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
