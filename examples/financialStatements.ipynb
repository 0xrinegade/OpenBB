    "# Financial Statements in the OpenBB Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenBB Platform data extensions provide access to financial statements as quarterly or annual.  There are also endpoints for ratios and other common non-GAAP metrics.  Most data providers require a subscription to access all data. Refer to the website of a specific provider for details on entitlements and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial statement functions are grouped under the `obb.equity.fundamental` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical financial statements consist of three endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balance Sheet: `obb.equity.fundamental.balance()`\n",
    "- Income Statement: `obb.equity.fundamental.income()`\n",
    "- Cash Flow Statement: `obb.equity.fundamental.cash()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parameters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `symbol`: The company's symbol.\n",
    "- `period`: 'annual' or 'quarter'. Default is 'annual'.\n",
    "- `limit`: Limit the number of results returned, from the latest. Default is 5. For perspective, 150 will go back to 1985. The amount of historical records varies by provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field Names\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations to keep in mind when working with financial statements data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every data provider has their own way of parsing and organizing the three financial statements.\n",
    "- Items within each statement will vary by source and by the type of company reporting.\n",
    "- Names of line items will vary by source.\n",
    "- \"Date\" values may differ because they are from the period starting/ending or date of reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example highlights how different providers will have different labels for compnay facts."
